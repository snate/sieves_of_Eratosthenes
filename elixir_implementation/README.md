# Elixir implementation

You can start the Elixir version of SoE by simply typing in an open terminal:

    bash start.sh

and then this command will open a REPL from which you can ask the SoeClient to
compute the prime numbers up to `limit`, that is the parameter you provide:

    SoeClient.Computer.compute_up_to <limit>
