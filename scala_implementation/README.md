# Scala implementation

You can start the Scala version of SoE by simply typing in an open terminal:

    bash start.sh

Then go to the `soe-client` folder and you can ask the SoeClient to compute the
prime numbers up to `limit`, that is the parameter you provide:

    bash run.sh <limit> <port>

where `port` is the (optional) parameter used to set the port on which the
client will listen.
